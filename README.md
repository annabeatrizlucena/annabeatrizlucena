## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the Federal University of Campina Grande, the same institution where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have a strong affinity for academic research, and my current focus is on web caching systems, where I aim to explore strategies to improve the performance and efficiency of these types of systems.
